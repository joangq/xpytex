# eXtensible Python to Latex Library

This library tries to simplify Python-to-LaTeX translation. It's goal is to be flexible and extensible.
It uses the generated Python [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) to generate string with LaTeX code. It heavily depends on the current syntax of Python, and therefore on the output generated by the `ast` module parser.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a Work In Progress.
> The library is stable enough for this examples,
> but still has coupling issues. Therefore, it's
> possible that it will be a lot of changes made.

# How to Use
